# scriptaseq

ScriptASeq is planned to be a music sequencing GUI frontend that can support nearly any backend through user-defined scripts. ScriptASeq's focus is on providing a convenient but very generic and flexible GUI for sequence editing, and allowing the user to control how a sequence is processed through scripts. The project is also planned to include a helper library for some of the more common functionality that user scripts will need, such as MIDI and OSC output.

ScriptASeq is currently in an early stage of development, and is not yet suitable for use except by developers of ScriptASeq.
